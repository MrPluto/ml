#### 4 assumptions that needs to be true and orthogonal
- Fit training set well on cost function
    - use bigger neural network or switching to a better optimization algorithm to improve it
- Fit dev set well on cost function
    - regularization or using bigger training set might help
- Fit test set well on cost function
    - using bigger dev set might help
- performs well in real world
    - if it doesn't perform well, means the dev/test set is not set correctly or the cost function is not evaluating the right thing


#### Using a single number evaluation metric
